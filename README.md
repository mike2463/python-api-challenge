# python-api-challenge
For this challenge I used Open Weather API and the Geoapify API to get information about weather for random cities around the world and then plotted those cities and their weather on a map. Then I found the nearest hotel to each of those cities. Along with this I did some statistical analysis of the weather based on their latitude. 
I was able to complete this challenge by using the activities that we did in class and by LA's. The LA's helped me the issues that I was having with the API's and to debug my code.
